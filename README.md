  -  ## [Business Goals](#business-goals)
      * From a business point of view, I would like to have an attractive, trustworthy and fully functional website that is responsive on all devices.
      * I wish to have a website that immediately makes clear the purpose of it. In this case a website selling beauty products.
      * Products on the website can be easily modified using CRUD(create, read, update, delete) by the admin.
      * Users can easily register an account to promote revisits to the site.
      * An account will not be required however to visit the site, therefore maximizing the potential customer base.
      * Hold and secure information from all current and new customers so they may login to place orders.
      * I want to promote revisits by allowing customers who have purchased items to leave reviews and ratings.
      * I want a site that is easy to navigate using a search bar which will search using a product name or description.
      * I want the user to have the ability to break all products down into smaller categories. Such as eyes, face etc so it has high functionality and an overall high UX experience.
      * A trustworthy, safe and secure checkout and payment system to reassure customers that their private information is safe when used on this site.
      This is essential as no matter how good a product is if the payment system looks unsafe chances are I will lose sales and visits.

- ### [User Stories](#user-stories):
   
   - #### As a Shopper:
      1. I want to be able to view a list of products which relate to what I am searching for. E.g: moisturizer.
      2. I want to be able to select an individual product and access more information on that product. For example, an item which when clicked on will bring up a seperate page featuring an image, a description and a rating for the product I have clicked on.
      3. I want to be able to sort through the entire list of available products by breaking them into different categories. Example: eyes, face, lips etc.
      4. To make the site more user friendly I would like to be able to sort through the entire product content by rating, price low to high, price high to low, alphabetical order etc. This way I can quickly navigate to the item I am searching for.
      5. I would like to read reviews left by other customers who have purchased the same item.
      6. I also want to quickly search through the site. A search bar would help me easily navigate using a product name or description.
      7. My search results being at the top of the page would make usage clear and efficient.
      8. Should I decide to buy the product a clear 'Buy Now' button will be needed.
      9. A button to easily increase and decrease the quantity of the product I wish to buy is required.
      10. In the shopping cart I would like to see a running total so I can control my spending and avoid any nasty shocks caused by going over budget.
      11. Ability to edit quantity of items in the basket would increase the overall functionality of the site.
      12. The shopping cart should also feature a 'Continue Shopping' button.
      13. Once I've finished shopping I'd like to easily checkout and pay for my purchases.
      14. I want a payment method and process that is trustworthy, safe and secure.
      15. For added peace of mind, the ability to confirm my order before checkout to avoid mistakes. Example: ordering too high a quantity of a particular item.
      16. I want to recieve an email with confirmation of my order after purchase.
      17. After I have recieved my product, I want to be able to revisit the site to leave a review and a rating so other customers can benefit from my experience.

- ### As a site user:
     1. I would like the option to create an account for use on this site but as I might just want to browse I dont want this to be mandatory to access the sites content.
     2. Should I create an account I would like to easily login and logout to access my personal account info on my personalised account.
     3. I would like to receive an email confirmation after registering to be able to verify that registration was successfull.
     4. I'd like to be able to easily recover my password incase I forget it so that I can recover access to my account.
     5. I'd like my profile to include my order history, order confirmation and the option to save my payment information.

- ### As a Store Owner:
     1. As admin , I want to be able to have control of CRUD. I want to add new products when I choose.
     2. I want to edit and update a product when needed. Example: new make-up colours added etc.
     3. I want to be able to delete products when needed. Example: discontinued. Low sales due to negative reviews etc.
